# Budy Avalanch

**Budy Avalanch** is a decentralized system that combines blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and document processing to create a secure and efficient ecosystem for managing medical records via NFTs. Users can upload PDF files, receive a summary generated by AI, and mint NFTs containing encrypted information.

The project includes the following components:

- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts in a Layer 1 blockchain using Gogopool on Avalanche.
- **Backend**: A Node.js server with endpoints for PDF processing and token transfers.
- **Frontend**: A Next.js application integrating Web3Auth and ethers.js for blockchain interaction.

Technologies
Node.js: Backend server with API endpoints.
Next.js: Frontend application using React.
Web3Auth: User authentication using Web3.
ethers.js: Blockchain interaction for transactions.
Gogopool: Manages the Budy blockchain on Avalanche (L1).
MercadoPago: Integrated for purchasing tokens and NFTs.
Google Gemini AI API: Used for PDF processing and summary generation.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm or yarn
Avalanche Wallet to interact with the Budy network
API keys for Google Gemini Language API and Web3Auth
Clone the Repository
bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/DigiCris/budy_avalanch.git
cd budy_avalanch
Backend: Setup and Running
Set Up Environment Variables
Install Dependencies
npm install 
Runing 
node server.js

From the frontend directory, run:

bash
Copiar código
cd frontend
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following variables:

bash
Copiar código
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
MERCADO_PAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mercado_pago_access_token
Start the Server

bash
Copiar código
npm start
The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Available Endpoints:

/api/process-pdf: Processes a PDF file and generates a summary using AI.
/api/transferBudy: Transfers Budy tokens to a specified address.
Frontend: Setup and Running
Install Dependencies

From the frontend directory, run:

bash
Copiar código
cd frontend
npm install
Configure Web3Auth and ethers.js

Create a .env.local file in the frontend directory with the following variables:

bash
Copiar código
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_web3auth_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
Start the Application

bash
Copiar código
npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:3001.

Smart Contracts: Deployment and Setup
Deploy on Avalanche

The smart contracts are configured for the Budy Blockchain network on Avalanche using Gogopool.

RPC URL: https://node.l1marketplace.com/ext/bc/7gmrCuAKCEX8DUhZEyNURzLi1SAx8JYW4jpzN7wsGSiGZa5Qb/rpc
Chain ID: 888766674
Currency Symbol: BDY
Block Explorer: You can verify transactions on the blockchain using the following block explorer:

Workflow
User Flow
Upload PDF and AI Processing: The user uploads their medical record in PDF format. Through the /api/process-pdf endpoint, a user-friendly summary is generated using the Google Generative Language API.
Token Purchase: Users purchase Budy (BDY) tokens using MercadoPago and can then transfer these tokens through the /api/transferBudy endpoint.
Mint NFTs: Using Budy tokens, users can mint NFTs that contain their encrypted medical records.
Authentication and File Download: Authentication is handled via Web3Auth, and files are securely stored. The user has access to their private key.
Share Medical Records: Users can choose to share their files via WhatsApp, Telegram, or email.
